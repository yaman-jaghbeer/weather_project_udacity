# weather_project_udacity
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. 

The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city
to where I live. To do this, you’ll follow the steps below:

**Extract the data from the database.** To export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where I live.
Using an SQL interface provide by Udacity I:
- Wrote a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
- Wrote a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.

**Create a line chart** that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. I will plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines.

**Make observations** about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
